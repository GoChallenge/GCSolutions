Benchmarks may report what follows:

    BenchmarkDecodePattern1 100000  15257 ns/op 13.83 MB/s  2184 B/op 92 allocs/op
    BenchmarkDecodePattern2 200000  11620 ns/op 13.51 MB/s  1504 B/op 69 allocs/op

    BenchmarkDecodePattern4 100000  12228 ns/op 13.17 MB/s  1520 B/op 69 allocs/op
    BenchmarkDecodePattern5 200000  8456 ns/op  15.61 MB/s  976 B/op  46 allocs/op

The use of `binary.Read` and other facilities make implementation simple;
however, they are somewhat inefficient due to type switching and other
preemptory allocation.  Were we to care about this, we would manually
scan the `io.Reader` ourselves without using its automatic struct
population mechanism.

Another consideration were this performance-critical would be to create a
dedicated Decoder type that would contain its own buffers to amortize
allocation costs across operations.
